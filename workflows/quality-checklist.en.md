## Use Case

You need standardized quality control checklists to ensure consistency. This workflow helps you:

- Create industry-specific checklists
- Conduct systematic quality checks
- Document verification with photos
- Track corrective actions

> ⚠️ **Quality**: Systematic checks reduce defects by 40-60% and customer complaints by 50%.

Inspection execution workflow:

PRE-INSPECTION:
1. Print checklist or load on tablet/phone
2. Gather tools:
   - Flashlight
   - Measuring tape
   - Level
   - Camera
   - Code book (if needed)
3. Review scope (what's being inspected today)

DURING INSPECTION:
1. Work methodically through checklist
2. Check each item, mark Pass/Fail
3. For failures:
   - Take photo
   - Note exact location
   - Describe what's wrong
   - Note code reference
4. Ask questions if unclear
5. Don't skip items

PHOTO DOCUMENTATION:
- Overall view (before inspection)
- Each deficiency (close-up + context)
- Critical passes (for verification)
- Overall view (after inspection)

Naming: [project]-[checklist-type]-[item#]-[date].jpg
Example: johnson-house-electrical-item12-2026-01-20.jpg

POST-INSPECTION:
1. Tally pass/fail count
2. Determine overall pass/fail
3. Write deficiency list with corrections needed
4. Sign and date checklist
5. Deliver to responsible party
6. Schedule re-inspection if needed

TIMELINE:
Small job (bathroom): 15-20 minutes
Medium job (whole house rough-in): 45-60 minutes
Large commercial: 2-3 hours

Save completed: ~/Cowork-Workspace/quality/inspections/[project]-[type]-[date].pdf

```

### Step 5: Quality metrics tracking

Monthly/quarterly analysis:

```
Quality metrics report for: [Business/Period]

PERIOD: January 2026
PROJECTS: 8 completed

INSPECTION STATISTICS:

Total inspections conducted: 24
By type:
- Electrical rough: 8
- Plumbing rough: 6
- Final walkthrough: 8
- HVAC: 2

First-time pass rate:
- Overall: 75% (18/24 passed first time)
- Electrical: 87% (7/8)
- Plumbing: 67% (4/6)
- Final: 75% (6/8)

Industry benchmark: 80% first-time pass
Assessment: Need improvement on plumbing ⚠️

DEFICIENCY ANALYSIS:

Total deficiencies: 32
By severity:
- Critical: 8 (25%)
- Non-critical: 24 (75%)

Most common deficiencies:
1. Improper pipe slope (plumbing) - 6 instances
2. Missing GFCI protection (electrical) - 4 instances
3. Inadequate clearances (various) - 3 instances

ROOT CAUSES:
1. Pipe slope: New plumber unfamiliar with code
   → Action: Code review training scheduled 02/01
2. GFCI: Oversight/forgetfulness
   → Action: Added to pre-drywall checklist reminder
3. Clearances: Design issues
   → Action: Review plans for clearances before starting

CORRECTION TIMELINESS:

Average time to correct: 2.1 days
Target: <3 days ✓

Corrections exceeding 3 days: 2 instances (both non-critical)

RE-INSPECTION PASS RATE:

First re-inspection: 95% pass (1 failure required 2nd re-inspect)

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS:

Quality-related complaints: 1 (12.5% of projects)
Issue: Paint finish uneven (non-critical deficiency missed)
Resolution: Re-painted at no charge
Prevention: Added paint quality item to final checklist

TRENDS:

Comparing to last quarter:
- First-pass rate: 75% (up from 70%) ✓ Improving
- Avg corrections time: 2.1 days (down from 2.8 days) ✓ Improving
- Complaints: 1 (down from 3) ✓ Improving

GOALS FOR NEXT PERIOD:

1. Achieve 85% first-pass rate (focus: plumbing)
2. Zero critical deficiencies on electrical
3. Maintain <3 day correction time
4. Zero quality complaints

## Troubleshooting

### Checklist too long (takes too much time)

**Cause**: Too much detail or irrelevant items
**Solution**: Streamline to essentials:

```
CHECKLIST OPTIMIZATION:

Review each item:
- Is this code-required or critical to function? → Keep
- Is this nice-to-have or cosmetic? → Remove or make non-critical
- Is this redundant with another item? → Combine

EXAMPLE REDUCTION:

Before (18 items, 45 minutes):
□ Screws 12" OC on ceiling
□ Screws 16" OC on walls
□ Screw heads below surface
□ No broken paper
□ Joints taped
□ Joints mudded
□ Corner bead installed
□ Corner bead straight
[...]

After (8 items, 20 minutes):
□ Fasteners: Proper spacing (12"/16" OC), heads set, no breaks ✓
□ Joints: Taped and mudded smooth (3 coats) ✓
□ Corners: Bead straight and secure ✓
[...combine related items]

Result: Same quality, less time
```

### Inspections skipped due to time pressure

**Cause**: Deadline pressure, checklist seen as optional
**Solution**: Make non-negotiable:

```
QUALITY GATE ENFORCEMENT:

Build inspection into workflow as mandatory gate:

WORKFLOW:
1. Work performed
2. □ GATE: Quality inspection (MUST PASS to proceed)
3. Next phase begins

No exceptions policy:
- Even if behind schedule
- Even if client pressuring
- Even if "looks fine"

Rationale:
- Fixing later = 10× more expensive
- Customer complaints = lost time + reputation damage
- Code violations = legal liability

TIME ALLOCATION:
Include inspection time in project schedule:
- Plan: "Rough-in + inspection" = work time + 30 min check
- Not: "Rough-in" (inspection forgotten)

ACCOUNTABILITY:
Crew doesn't leave site until inspection done
Inspector signs off before next phase starts
```

### Subjective items (inconsistent evaluation)

**Cause**: "Looks good" is subjective
**Solution**: Objective criteria:

```
MAKE CRITERIA MEASURABLE:

Subjective (bad):
□ Paint finish is smooth

Objective (good):
□ Paint finish: No visible brush marks from 3 ft, passes hand test (feels smooth)

Subjective:
□ Clean workspace

Objective:
□ Workspace: No debris, tools put away, sweep floor (no visible dirt)

Subjective:
□ Joints taped well

Objective:
□ Joints: Tape embedded in mud, no bubbles, edges feathered 6" beyond tape

TESTING METHODS:
- Visual: "From X feet" (standardizes viewing distance)
- Touch: "Hand test" (run hand over surface)
- Measurement: "No gap >1/8 inch" (use gauge)
- Function: "Operates 3× without sticking" (test operation)
```

---

## Variations

### Customer acceptance checklist

```
Client final walkthrough checklist:

Completed with customer present:
- Walk through each room
- Customer checks quality themselves
- Sign off on acceptance OR note issues

BENEFITS:
- Customer feels involved
- Catches cosmetic items you might miss
- Documented acceptance = prevents later disputes
- Builds trust

WALKTHROUGH FORM:
Room: Living room
□ Acceptable ✓ / □ Needs attention: ______
Customer initials: ___

[Repeat for each room/area]

Overall acceptance:
□ Accept as-is ✓
□ Punch list items (see attached)

Customer signature: ___ Date: ___
```

### Tiered checklists (basic vs premium)

```
Offer service levels with different quality checks:

BASIC SERVICE:
- 10-point checklist (essentials only)
- Faster, lower cost

PREMIUM SERVICE:
- 25-point checklist (comprehensive)
- Higher quality, higher price

EXAMPLE - Car detailing:

BASIC ($50, 1 hour):
□ Exterior wash
□ Vacuum interior
□ Windows cleaned

PREMIUM ($150, 3 hours):
□ All basic items PLUS:
□ Clay bar treatment
□ Paint sealant
□ Interior shampoo
□ Leather conditioning
□ Engine bay cleaned
□ Headlight restoration
□ 15-point final inspection

Customer chooses service level upfront
Checklist matches what they paid for
```

## Best Practices

1. **Code-based** : Reference specific code sections (NEC, IPC, IRC, health codes)
2. **Photo everything** : Photos prove work quality and protect from false claims
3. **Non-negotiable gates** : Quality checks are mandatory, not optional
4. **Objective criteria** : Measurable standards, not "looks good"
5. **Training tool** : Use checklists to train new employees on standards
6. **Version control** : Update checklists when codes change (date versions)
7. **Client involvement** : Walk-through with customer builds trust and catches preferences
8. **Track metrics** : Analyze deficiency patterns to prevent recurring issues
