## Troubleshooting

### Difficulty formalizing tacit knowledge

**Cause**: "I know how to do it but can't explain it"
**Solution**: Structured interview method

```
TACIT KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE:

1. AUDIO RECORDING during execution:
   - Activate smartphone recorder
   - Comment aloud DURING gesture
   - "I'm doing X because Y, checking Z, if W then..."

2. TRANSCRIPTION + QUESTIONING:
   Reread transcription and for each action ask Claude:

   "Analyze this transcription and identify:
   - Unexplained actions (automatic gestures)
   - Implicit decisions (why this choice?)
   - Detected signals (what triggers action?)
   - Unmentioned alternatives (plan B if doesn't work?)"

3. THIRD-PARTY OBSERVATION:
   - Film OR have apprentice/colleague observe
   - Request questions ("Why do you do that?")
   - Note questions → answers = documentation content

4. MEMORABLE FAILURES:
   - Recall past failed interventions
   - What went wrong? Why?
   - Since then, what systematic check added?
   → These checks = externalized tacit knowledge

Repeat on 3-5 executions to cover contextual variations
```

### Lack of time to document

**Cause**: Operational activity priority
**Solution**: Opportunistic incremental documentation

```
TIME-SAVING STRATEGY:

Document 1 procedure/month (vs all at once):
- Choose most often taught (immediate ROI)
- 2h concentration one calm Friday afternoon
- Pre-filled template (step 2) = 50% time saving

Delegate collaborative documentation:
- Apprentice writes draft after observation
- You review/correct/validate (30 min vs 2h writing)
- Apprentice learns by formalizing (double benefit)

Reuse existing:
- Already taken site photos → annotate
- Client explanation emails → adapt to sheet format
- Detailed quotes → procedure basis

Capitalize training:
- During apprentice/intern training, record
- Presented support = documentation basis
- Questions asked = automatic FAQ

Realistic schedule:
- 10 critical procedures = 20h invested
- ROI: -80% future new hire training time (100h+/year savings)
- Payback < 6 months if hiring/handover planned
```

### Recipient resistance (not motivated)

**Cause**: Training perceived as constraint, no felt need
**Solution**: Intrinsic motivation + recognition

```
ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES:

1. INVOLVE in design:
   "What would help you most to progress?"
   → Co-create path vs impose
   → Ownership + real needs adaptation

2. GAMIFY progression:
   - Visible milestones (badges, levels)
   - "Before/after" photo portfolio (work pride)
   - Skills development graph (progress visualization)

3. PROGRESSIVE AUTONOMY:
   - Not "do exactly as I say"
   - "Test, experiment in safe framework, we debrief"
   - Empowerment (trust) > infantilizing control

4. PUBLIC RECOGNITION:
   - Present to customer: "It's [Name] who did this part"
   - Value to colleagues (meeting/break)
   - LinkedIn recommendations (if employee)

5. CAREER PERSPECTIVE:
   - Targeted certifications (advanced degrees, qualifications)
   - Future responsibilities (team lead, site autonomy)
   - Skills-linked salary evolution

If resistance persists: Frank discussion needs/expectations (trade fit?)
```

### Obsolete documentation (trade evolution)

**Cause**: Standards change, techniques evolve
**Solution**: Versioning + annual review

```
DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE SYSTEM:

1. SIMPLE VERSIONING:

Header each sheet:
"Version 2.1 | Last update: 03/15/2024 | Next review: 03/2025"

Changelog end document:
v2.1 (03/2024): Added step X following new standard Y
v2.0 (01/2024): Complete overhaul (old process obsolete)
v1.5 (06/2023): Correction step 3 error

2. SYSTEMATIC ANNUAL REVIEW:

Schedule:
- June each year (slow construction period)
- 1 dedicated day
- Checklist: [Procedures list] → Status [OK/Update/Obsolete]

Update criteria:
□ New standard published?
□ New equipment used?
□ Error detected in sheet?
□ Better method identified?

3. CONTRIBUTIVE REPORTING:

Allow users to report:
- Procedure error
- Missing information
- Tested improved method

Simple form:
"Sheet [name] - Problem: [description] - Proposal: [correction]"

Quarterly report processing

4. REGULATORY WATCH:

Alert subscriptions:
- Professional organization newsletters
- Official standards bulletin
- Trade technical journals

Upon new applicable text:
□ Identify impacted procedures
□ Immediate update (don't wait annual review)
□ Team communication (meeting/email)

VERSION ARCHIVING:

Keep obsolete versions in /archives/ folder
Useful for:
- Understand practice evolution
- Decision traceability
- Trade history training
```

### Micro-learning video (smartphone generation)

Format adapted to digital native apprentices:

```
SHORT CONTENT STRATEGY:

Principle: 1 video = 1 gesture (2-3 min max)

Minimal equipment:
- Recent smartphone (integrated stabilization)
- Support/tripod ($10)
- Lighting: Natural light OR LED site spotlight

Efficient shooting:
1. Blank rehearsal (gesture fluidity)
2. Record 3 takes (keep best)
3. Basic smartphone editing (cut intro/outro)
4. Export 720p (quality/file size compromise)

Video library:
- 20-30 short videos > 3 long videos (attention span)
- Private YouTube playlist OR shared Dropbox
- Numbered thumbnails (learning order)

Engagement:
- Comments enabled (apprentice questions)
- Simple update (redo obsolete video)
- Mobile accessible (site, workshop)

ROI: 1h shooting+editing = 10-year reusable support (vs repeating explanation x20)
```

### Augmented apprenticeship (digital + in-person)

Best of both worlds mix:

```
HYBRID MODEL:

IN-PERSON (irreplaceable):
- Manual technical gestures (touch, feeling)
- Real-time error detection (immediate correction)
- Customer relations (live observation)
- Unexpected situations (context adaptation)

DIGITAL (complementary):
- Theoretical review (videos, sheets)
- Procedure verification (mobile checklist)
- Work photo sharing (asynchronous feedback)
- Off-site questions (messaging)

TYPICAL ORGANIZATION:

Monday-Thursday: Duo site work (field learning)
Friday morning: Digital theory (videos, quizzes, discussions)
Friday afternoon: Week debriefing + next week projection

Tools:
- WhatsApp/Signal: Site photos + quick questions
- Dropbox/Drive: Mobile procedure sheet access
- Trello: Acquired/in-progress skills tracking

Advantages:
- Pace flexibility (digital at own pace)
- Progress traceability (digital portfolio)
- Permanent accessibility (evening/weekend reviews)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start small** — Document 3 critical procedures before aiming for completeness
2. **Show, make do, let do** — Classic effective pedagogical progression
3. **Feedback loops** — Request doc user feedback for continuous improvement
4. **Visual priority** — Photos/videos > long text (understanding +70%)
5. **Trade language** — Use field vocabulary, not academic jargon
6. **Valued mistakes** — Document common errors = prevention
7. **Living update** — Evolving vs frozen knowledge base
8. **Recognize contributors** — Value those who enrich documentation (collective motivation)

**Golden rule**: Transfer = short-term time investment, long-term time savings. 20h documentation = 200h repetitions avoided over 5 years.
